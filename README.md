# Fearless-Heights
Is a Serious Game (term for a genre of games with the purpose of teaching or helping the user) developed in Unity Engine in order to help the users overcome their fear of heights and edges.
Developed for my bachelor's degree project and at the current moment i am refactoring the code to be more professional.
